    <p>A computer is an electronic device that can store, process, and retrieve data, and perform mathematical and
        logical operations. Computers can be programmed to perform a wide range of tasks, such as storing data,
        calculating algorithms, and displaying information. Most computers use a binary system, with 0 and 1 being the
        two variables used to complete tasks.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in pictorial or textual form. A discrete monitor
        comprises a visual display, support electronics, power supply, housing, electrical connectors, and external user
        controls.</p>

    <h2 id="KEYBOARD">KEYBOARD</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A computer keyboard is a peripheral input device modeled after the typewriter keyboard[1][2] which uses an
        arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Replacing early punched cards
        and paper tape technology, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the main input method for
        computers since the 1970s, supplemented by the computer mouse since the 1980s.</p>

    <h2 id="MOUSE">MOUSE</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A computer mouse (plural mice, also mouses)[nb 1] is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional
        motion relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of the pointer (called a
        cursor) on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface of a computer.</p>

    <h2 id="CPU">CPU</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that acts as its ‚Äúcontrol center.‚Äù The
        CPU, also referred to as the ‚Äúcentral‚Äù or ‚Äúmain‚Äù processor, is a complex set of electronic circuitry that runs
        the machine's operating system and apps.</p>
    
    <h2 id="UPS">UPS</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a device that provides backup power to protect computers from damage
        during a power outage. UPS systems are commonly used in data servers, computer systems, industrial settings, and
        laboratories.</p>
